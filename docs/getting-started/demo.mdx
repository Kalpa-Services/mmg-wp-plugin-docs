### Payment Flow Demonstration

When the plugin is installed and activated, the payment flow is as follows:
- The customer adds items to their cart and proceeds to checkout.
- The customer selects the MMG Checkout Payment method and is redirected to the MMG Checkout Payment page to complete the payment.
- The customer is redirected back to the WooCommerce order confirmation page.
- The payment is processed and the order is placed.
